Platform-Specific Notes for arpsend

The author develops this program on Solaris 9 on SPARC, so that's the platform
you can expect to work.    The author has not ported the program to other platforms,
and in fact, it currently ignores much of what 'configure' discovers.

Others have contributed patches to make this program run on several other platforms.
The author is usually unable to test whether these patches work on those platforms.
